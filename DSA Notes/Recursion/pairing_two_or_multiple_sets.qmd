title: "Paring of Two or Multiple Arrays"
---

### ğŸ“– Theory

We will be given with **[[a, b, c], [x, y, z]]** and need to pair them in all possible ways as **ax, ay, az, bx** and so on.

---

**Using Recursion**

- At each step (for each array), pick one element from the current array.
- Move to the next array and repeat the process, building up the current combination.
- Base Case: If you have picked one element from each array (i.e., reached the end), print or store the current combination.
- This approach generates all possible pairings (or tuples) by exploring every choice at each level.


```cpp
  Base Case:
    i >= arr.size();

  (   i   )             output
  [a, b, c] & [x, y, z] , {}
      |               (   i   )  output              (   i   )  output              (   i   )  output
      |-- [a, b, c] & [x, y, z] , {a,} & [a, b, c] & [x, y, z] , {b,} & [a, b, c] & [x, y, z] , {c,}
                          |
                          |                       < i output                       < i output                       < i output
                          |-- [a, b, c] & [x, y, z] , {a, x} & [a, b, c] & [x, y, z] , {a, y} & [a, b, c] & [x, y, z] , {a, z}                                                                                               
      
Like wise bx, by, bz and cx, cy, cz.
